# 57b - aws amplify tech talk demo

This project was created as part of 57b tech talk "BaaS with AWS amplify". It is not meant to be a fully-fledge app, but just a quick and simple demo for the "aws-amplify" tool

Search in `/techtalk-guide` folder for a step-by-step of everything that was done in the tech-talk demo, if you want to implement by yourself

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
